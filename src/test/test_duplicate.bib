                  considers the constraints at the position level. In
                  both schemes, the position and velocity constraints
                  are not both satisfied in discrete time. A first
                  attempt to improve the time simulation is made by
                  directly using the Gearâ€“Guptaâ€“Leimkuhler (GGL)
                  approach for Differential Algebraic Equations (DAE),
                  that solves, in discrete time, the constraints on
                  both position and velocity levels. This obtained
                  direct projection scheme succeeds in solving in
                  discrete time both position and velocity
                  constraints, but introduces some chattering at
                  contact after a finite accumulation of impacts. A
                  second new scheme is proposed that improves the
                  direct projected scheme by combining several steps
                  of activation and projection to avoid the chattering
                  effect. The stability and the local order of the
                  scheme will be discussed. The usefulness of the
                  scheme is demonstrated on several academic examples

                  modeling and simulation of an electrical circuit
